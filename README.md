# StudentHelper

Author: Kamil Faliński

Destiny: For myself and my friends to organize our grades and responsibilities.

My goal is to create the perfect app for students. One that will be a combination of the advantages of other similar programs. The app will appear on personal computers and devices with Android systems, maybe also as a web app.

This app is not perfect right now, but I'm working on it. The program will be developing along with it the development of programming skills, so brave yourself :)

The closest goals:
  - Serialization (Maybe JSON)
  - More clean code
  - JUnit
